Vikram and Pavithra want to decide upon a design for Delta T Shirt. They decided to put up a poll among Delta members to select a design. So they asked their juniors to develop a portal which facilitates polling among teams.

They need a website which allows creation of teams and polls within the team members built upon a full fledged frontend and backend.

## Normal mode:

- Have a user management system with authentication that allows users to register and login on the site
- Create a team and be able to invite users to the team
- Create a poll with variable number of text options within the team
- Create a dashboard for a team and display the polls in chronological order
- Show the results of poll after admin ends it
- Design a neat, intuitive UI ( make the site responsive, legible text, etc )

Vikram is feeling lazy and wants to set deadlines for automatically ending the polls and add some other cool features

## Hackermode:

- Have a deadline for automatically ending polls
- Support for different types of options such as images, audio and video
- Notifications to the admin when someone submits a vote, joins their team using invite, etc
- Validate the registration forms (check for duplicate usernames, determine password strength, etc)
- Add plots/graphs to visualize results of polls
- Prevent SQL injection

## Hackermode++:

- Ability to add multiple admins and user roles (like teachers, CR, students etc)
- Send notifications through email
- Google Calendar API integration to keep track of deadlines for polls
- Add chat and real time video conferencing feature

## Submission

Submission will be to your mentors. You can ask them any questions you may have.

Normal Mode is required. Hacker mode is very highly encouraged.

Submission Deadline - Tuesday, August 13th
